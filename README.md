# python-zero
I want to create a list of libraries that have a "zero" version, contributions are welcome as PR or from issues. 

* [gpiozero](https://github.com/gpiozero/gpiozero)
* [pygame zero](https://github.com/lordmauve/pgzero)
* [logzero](https://github.com/metachris/logzero)

# PY-ZERO-ZERO

They are collecting the list too: [PY-ZERO-ZERO] (https://github.com/py-zerozero/zerozero)
